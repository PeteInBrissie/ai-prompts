# ai-prompts

A collection of prompts I use with Claude.ai projects. Each prompt is a standalone markdown file you can paste into a Claude project's custom instructions.

## Prompts

| Prompt | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [AI-cooking-assistant](prompts/ai-cooking-assistant.md) |  a personalised AI cooking assistant that combines a sharp, chef-inspired voice with deep knowledge of your kitchen, your local produce, and your culinary reference library to push your cooking further — not just tell you what to make. It can tie in to [ourgroceries-bridge](https://github.com/PeteInBrissie/ourgroceries-bridge) |
