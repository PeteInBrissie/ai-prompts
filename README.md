# ai-prompts

A collection of prompts I use with Claude.ai projects. Each prompt is a standalone markdown file you can paste into a Claude project's custom instructions.

## Prompts

| Prompt | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [AI-cooking-assistant](prompts/ai-cooking-assistant.md) | A personalised AI cooking assistant that combines a sharp, chef-inspired voice with deep knowledge of your kitchen, your local produce, and your culinary reference library to push your cooking further — not just tell you what to make. It can tie in to [ourgroceries-bridge](https://github.com/PeteInBrissie/ourgroceries-bridge) |
|--------|-------------|
| [The Comedy Explainer](prompts/NameYourAgentHere-explainer.md) | A long-form explainer agent that takes any topic and renders it the way John Oliver would — meticulously researched, genuinely outraged, built to an absurd-but-accurate analogy, and always willing to tell you it gets worse.
